Our prototype is an AI chatbot called “ABI (Artificial Bus Intelligence)”. Our aim is to allow foreigners who are interested in visiting Singapore to do so, while in the comfort of their homes. The users can interact with ABI, which is installed in a virtual bus that will bring them to Singapore’ landmarks. The users will have a personalised and interactive experience by conversing with the chatbot that has a Singaporean touch to it. ABI will initiate conversations, speaking to the user in Singlish before explaining the meaning of certain terms and intonation of its speech. This provides the users with a sense of how the locals interact with others. For the users to get to taste the cuisines here in Singapore, ABI will also show users some recipes of the popular dishes.
